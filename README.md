# Data Science Portfolio

## Description

Welcome to my Data Science portfolio, showcasing a broad array of projects and experiments that highlight my experience in machine learning (ML) and data analytics. This repository serves as a comprehensive showcase of my technical skills, applied across various industries and problems.

## Projects

Each project included here is documented with detailed explanations of the problem, the methodology employed, and the outcomes achieved. The projects are organized into categories based on the ML technique used:

### Classic Models
- **Applications**: SVM, Random Forest, neural networks, logistic regression, and XGBoost in business use cases like credit assignment, inventory prediction, and risk assessment.

### Time Series
- **Analysis and Prediction**: Using both statistical and deep learning models.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- **Projects**: Ranging from sentiment analysis to text generation.

### Computer Vision
- **Solutions**: For image classification and analysis.

### Audio Processing
- **Experiments**: Related to voice recognition and sound classification.

### Large Language Models (LLMs)
- **Advanced Applications**: Using pretrained language models.

## Technologies

Projects have been implemented using cutting-edge tools and libraries in the field of data science, including Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and more.

## Collaboration

I invite you to explore the projects, use the code as you wish, and contribute with improvements or suggestions. If you're interested in collaborating on a project or have questions, feel free to open an issue or send me a message.
